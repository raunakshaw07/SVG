              Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually
              round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
              tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients baked at a
              high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

              Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of
              wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or
              other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.

              Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted and
              killed animals for meat since prehistoric times. The advent of
              civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as
              chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle.
